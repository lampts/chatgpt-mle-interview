| Why do we try to reduce the size of a big trained model through techniques such as knowledge distillation instead of just training a small model from the beginning? | HuyenChip | Training a smaller model from the beginning can be more efficient and require less computational resources compared to training a large model and then reducing its size through techniques like knowledge distillation. However, there are several reasons why it can be beneficial to first train a larger model and then distill its knowledge.
One reason is that large models often have more capacity and can learn more complex patterns in the data compared to smaller models. This can lead to better performance on a given task, especially when the training data is limited. By first training a large model and then distilling its knowledge, it is possible to transfer the larger model's knowledge and performance to a smaller model, effectively "compressing" the large model's knowledge into a more efficient form.
Another reason is that distillation techniques can provide additional fine-tuning and regularization to the smaller model, improving its generalization ability and reducing overfitting. This can be especially useful when the training data is noisy or limited, as the distillation process can act as a form of transfer learning, allowing the smaller model to benefit from the larger model's knowledge.
Overall, while it is often more efficient to train a small model from the beginning, there are situations where it can be beneficial to first train a large model and then distill its knowledge to improve the performance and generalization of a smaller model. |
